"""
In this test the client code sends an update, guaranteeing that the workflow worker is
processing a workflow task (WFT) at the time that the update is admitted by the server. To
do this it must synchronize the workflow and client. This uses techniques that should
never be used in real workflows. The synchronization must be threading-based as opposed to
asyncio-based, since the point is to not allow the workflow to yield while it is waiting
for notification from the client. In order for the workflow and client to share the same
module namespace, we use UnsandboxedWorkflowRunner. But this means that the workflow and
client code execute in the same thread. Therefore we do the client's thread-blocking
synchronization calls in a new thread, via asyncio.to_thread, so that both client and
workflow can use thread-blocking waits on the shared threading.Event object.
