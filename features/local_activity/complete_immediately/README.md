# Local Activity completes immediately

When a Local Activity completes immediately after being scheduled (in the same Workflow Task), the
result is delivered back to the Workflow.

Assuming the Workflow does not schedule any more Local Activities in this Workflow Task, the task
completes and a Local Activity marker is recorded in history.
