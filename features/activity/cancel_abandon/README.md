# Activity cancellation
Activities may be cancelled in three different ways, this feature spec covers the
Abandon mode.

Each feature workflow in this folder should start an activity and cancel it
using the abandon mode. The implementation should demonstrate that the activity
keeps running and receives no cancel notification after the workflow requests one.
