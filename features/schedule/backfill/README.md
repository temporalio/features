# Backfill schedule

Schedules can be backfilled. This means you can specify a time range in the past to run the schedule on as though it
just occurred.

Each feature:

* Creates a paused every-minute schedule
* Adds a backfill for 3 years ago and two minutes ago to 3 years ago
* Adds a backfill for 32 minutes ago to 30 minutes ago
* Confirms the backfilled schedule ran 6 times (start time and end time are both inclusive)
