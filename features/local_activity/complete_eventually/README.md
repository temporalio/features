# Local Activity completes eventually

When a Local Activity completes in a subsequent Workflow Task, the result is delivered back to the
Workflow.

Any commands (timer in this example) generated by the Workflow are sent to the server when the
Worker issues a Workflow Task Heartbeat.

When the Local Activity eventually completes, a Local Activity marker is recorded in history.
